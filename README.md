# Tensorflow-on-Multiple-GPUs
Parallelize multi-gpu deep learning models in tensorflow

* Parallelized existing Tensorflow code using mirrored strategu for lung cancer detection on different types and number of GPUs. Slurm was utilized for workload managing.

* Vizualized training and loss accuracy on Tensorboard.

* Analysis: Analysed and compared the speedup and efficiency of the program running on different processing units (GPUs and CPU)
